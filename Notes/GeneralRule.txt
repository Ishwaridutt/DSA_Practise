These steps you need to follow while solving a problem:

– Understand the question, read it 2-3 times.
– Take an estimate of the required complexity.
– find, edge cases based on the constraints.
– find a brute-force solution. ensure it will pass.
– Optimize code, ensure, and repeat this step.
– Dry-run your solution(pen & paper) on the test cases and edge cases.
– Code it and test it with the test cases and edge cases.
– Submit solution. Debug it and fix it, if the solution does not work.


While going through the problem you need to ask a few questions yourself…

Did you understand the problem fully?
Would you be able to explain this question to someone else?
What and how many inputs are required?
What would be the output for those inputs
Do you need to separate out some modules or parts from the problem?
Do you have enough information to solve that question? If not then read the question again or clear it to the interviewer.
